This is our Highschool project, it consists of a form that you can take and it will try to predict the option that you have taken / will take in swiss highschool.
The goal of this project is to emulate a scientific bachelor thesis at a lower scale. 

Starting from 0 knowledge in programming, We learned Javascript, HTML and CSS during the summer break. 
Then during 6 months we've

- researched in  the algorithm K-NN and K mean clustering, 
- collected data from students our school through a form
- proposed solutions to address the encountered problem (especially the high variance we've encountered)
- implemented the algorithm K-NN, k mean clustering, k-fold-cross-Validation and the web page from scratch in javascript.

We came to the conclusion that k mean clustering seemed very good for such applications but we lacked a several amount of data to make use of it

To try the project by yourself, you can run index.html on a (local) server. 
this is the research document:  Document_theorique_TM.pdf

Many thanks to my partner Vibbeshan for this experience that taught us much more than machine learning, as many of you would know, It is no easy feat to work together on an ambitious task.
